# Unity-Protein-Visualization
-Unity Protein Visualization using Unity and C# analysis on PDB Files. 

-Visualizing proteins in 3D structure and formatting data output in unity console.

-The idea is to implement problem solving techniques on the PDB file to get the best analysis .

-With detection and differentiation of helices and beta sheets of the protein using 2 different colors (red and blue ) .

-Also rotation algorithms are used (around x-axis, y-axis, z-axis and an arbitrary lines).
